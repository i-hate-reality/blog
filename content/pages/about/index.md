Hi \0

On the internet I'm mostly known as \[Maybe\] Waffle \[Lapkin\]. 
My pronouns are it/its. 

I'm `rust` evangelist and the best desktop app \[citation needed\]. 

As of time of writing, I'm mostly working on the rust compiler.
I'm a member of the [`T-compiler-contributors`] and have [more than 150 merged PRs] to [`rust-lang/rust`]. Although I also co-maintain [`teloxide`] and sometimes work on smaller personal projects.

I also like taking photographs, mostly of plants and sunsets.

      style="border-radius: 8px; width: 80%;"
