            <p>As you may know, I have a (russian) <a href="https://t.me/ihatereality">telegram channel</a>. One day I had a random thought about something I could make there. Now it became a tradition‚Ä¶</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>This year, on August 13, 13:00 I‚Äôve <a href="https://t.me/ihatereality/2282">posted</a> a poll with a prompt ‚ÄúRate yesterday‚Äù and the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>+2 (excellent)</li>
<li>+1</li>
<li>0 (neutral)</li>
<li>-1</li>
<li>-2 (terrible)</li>
</ul>

  <div class="callout-body">
    <p>Notice that the [-2; 2] scale is used instead of the usual [1; 5] to better empathize the balance, make it more unbiased and easier to think about. This was inspired by the article ‚Äú<a href="https://optozorax.github.io/p/5-point-ratings-are-wrong/">5-–±–∞–ª—å–Ω–∞—è —à–∫–∞–ª–∞ –æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∫–∏ –Ω–µ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω–∞</a>‚Äù by optozorax.</p>

<p>I didn‚Äôt intend anything serious. It was partly a joke, partly a way to let go of the feelings (the previous day was <strong>terrible</strong>, it scored -2 from me). The poll got some votes and comments. The next day I‚Äôve made an identical one. And the day after that too. And then, it became a tradition.</p>
<p>I received some good feedback about these polls. Some people even were waiting for them! (I tried to post them near 1:00 every day). People loved these polls for some reason‚Ä¶</p>
<p>It didn‚Äôt last for long though. I was making such polls for a week (ie the last one was posted on August 19). The reason I stopped posting polls was that I didn‚Äôt want it to be the only thing I do on the channel. I didn‚Äôt want my channel to look like it looked on August 18 ‚Äî a single poll and that‚Äôs it. And I couldn‚Äôt post something other every day either.</p>
<p>So, I stopped. Then on September 1, I <a href="https://t.me/ihatereality/2328">did</a> a ‚ÄúRate last summer‚Äù poll. And then I didn‚Äôt do anything like that for a long time. Now I want to revive this tradition (as of writing this it‚Äôs October 8 and I‚Äôve just posted a <a href="https://t.me/ihatereality/2425">new poll</a>)</p>
<p>But why? Why did people like these polls, this silly little tradition? The short answer: I don‚Äôt know. But I think these posts let people reflect on their lives a little, they open up space for quite interesting and cosy discussions, they let us pause for a moment and think ‚Äúwhat has really happened (today)?‚Äù.</p>
<p>And in the insane reality, we all live in these pauses are far more valuable, than it may seem at first glance.</p>
<p>Take care, bye.</p>
